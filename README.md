## üîç Problem Statement
problem:
  objective: Predict whether a person is an Extrovert or Introvert
  based_on:
    - Time spent alone
    - Stage fear
    - Attendance at social events
    - Going outside frequency
    - Post frequency
    - Friends circle size
    - Responses to social fatigue

## üßº Data Preprocessing
data_preprocessing:
  imputation:
    numerical_columns: mean
    categorical_columns: mode

  encoding:
    binary_features_encoded:
      - Stage_fear
      - Drained_after_socializing
    target_encoding:
      variable: Personality
      method: label encoding
      mapping:
        Extrovert: 0
        Introvert: 1

  scaling:
    method: MinMaxScaler
    applied_to: social activity-related numeric columns
